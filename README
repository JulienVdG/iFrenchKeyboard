1. This requires Android 4.1 (API level 16) or later, it was tested on a Nexus 7

2. You need some way to connect a real hardware keyboard, preferably a full PC-style keyboard
   e.g. a USB OTG cable (from some electronics stores or online sellers) which connects to the USB micro B
   socket on your Android device and in turn connects a USB keyboard

3. The keyboard should show up in Android's "Language & input" settings. It should have its own section
   "PHYSICAL KEYBOARD" between "KEYBOARD & INPUT METHODS" and "SPEECH" If your keyboard isn't listed there
   then you need to solve that problem first.

4. Pick your keyboard from the settings, pick "Set up keyboard layouts" and you should see "English (UK)"
   listed with the comment "Nick's Extra Layouts".

5. Most keys on a UK keyboard should now behave as labelled. e.g. Shift + 2 should give the double quote "
   and AltGr+4 should give a Euro symbol â‚¬

6. However, the "extra" key not present on US keyboards is not mapped sensibly by Android. It's treated
   identically to the backslash key instead. On a UK keyboard this key usually has # and ~ on it. The Linux
   kernel knows the two keys are different, but Android does not, so it will require further work to fix this.

7. If you have any insight into how best to work around this limitation in Android 4.1+ please let me know
   via GitHub, alternatively please let the Android team know that there's a good reason why Linux encodes
   this key separately and they should do the same even if the US keyboard layout treats these two keys the
   same.
